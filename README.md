# AI Optimization Agent Project
# AI Optimizer Agent

An AI-powered Operations Research assistant that can automatically build optimization models (Phase 1)
and generate heuristic solutions (Phase 2).

## Setup
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohit456780/ai-optimizer-agent.git
   cd ai-optimizer-agent
2. Create and activate virtual environment
3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Phase 1 Goals

Build LLM prompts and structure for model-building.

Auto-generate Pyomo/OR-Tools formulations.
Phase 2 Goals

Develop heuristic and metaheuristic solvers (Genetic, Tabu, etc.).
